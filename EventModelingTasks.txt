1. Use event groupings (eventFreqAndDates.csv) to attempt individual models.
	a. use only groups with >= 40 observations.
  
	b. Compile selected variables from models by event.

	c. Show Fl variables on EEMS graph for each event--separate EEMs per event
	-Choose an EEMs graph to use as an example of where things are
	-use files here: .\raw_data\opticalSummary to locate where signals are
     -Draw line between signals for ratios
	 -Done: examine correlations of variables
	 
	d. Include multiple EEMs graphs per page to examine locations of signals

	e. Reduce signals based on similarity

	f. Build model for whole data set based on final signals chosen

	g. Plot by event to evaluate effectiveness
	

2. Done: consider refitting with survreg() using LASSO variables and examining slopes by event
		xxxconsider automated way to keep track of slopes for individual events within group regressions
		xxx-maybe use median regression for this.

3. Done: run regression with the ~90  L3 samples
4. Lasso regression with e. coli and entero

5. Heuristic overlap analysis: decision tree
	-Choose least overlap with local sanitary sewer signals or high contamination signals and split
	-continue after splits to a point where there is too much overlap
	-Graph with boxplots or counts of categories
